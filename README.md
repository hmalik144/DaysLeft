# DaysLeft

A shift tracker for rural work carried out by backpackers.

# Overview

Working holider makers in australia are given the option to carry out 3 months of rural work in exchange for a second year working holiday visa. The problem with working holiday makers carrying out rural work many are subjected to exploitation and abude. 
Here is an article in The Guardian outlining the horrible conditions

This is part of the problem within rural work, but one of many issues is exploitation on pay. I created this application to tackle the problem.
With days left a backpacker can track the work they have done and dispute exploitation when its "their word against mine".

# Features

## Simple sign up
All you need is an email address and password (Social media sign up coming soon)

## Find employer
Easily find the employer you are working for by their ABN (Australian business number) or name. This ensures you are working for a legal entity.

## Simple shift logging
Once you have submitted a shift it is simple to repeat. If you are working for an agency it is simple to log various employers.

## Visa data compilation
Compiling data for your second year visa application is long and tedious - with days left at the click of a button you can have your data needed for download.

## Piece rate accepted
Many other working day trackers only work for hourly paid shifts. Days left incorporates the tracking of piece rate (eg. $6.00 per kg or $2.00 per bucket) shifts which you can log and track.

## Home screen metric
Includes the progress so far through your 88 days. Piece rate totals, hourly paid totals and accumulated totals.
